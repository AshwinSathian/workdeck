# Changelog

Notable changes to WorkDeck. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). While the version is below 1.0, a minor release may change file formats; `workdeck.conf` carries a `version` key so `card` can refuse a format it does not know.

Claude Code keeps an installed plugin at the version in `plugin.json`, so every fix that users should receive comes with a version bump and a tag.

## [Unreleased]

The planner, which the README calls 0.2. It is on the main branch and has no version yet: `card version` and `plugin.json` still say 0.1.3. A new install takes the main branch and receives it. A plugin that is already installed keeps what it had when it was installed, until the version changes.

### Added

- The skill `/workdeck:plan <spec path> [what to change]`. It cuts a specification, one markdown file committed in the repository, into an outline with one row per card. A script checks the outline, an agent that did not write it reviews it, you approve it, and it lands through a pull request from a `plan/*` branch that changes nothing else.
- The agent `workdeck:plan-reviewer`, which reviews an outline against its specification.
- `card plan` in five forms: `card plan` checks every outline, `card plan new <spec path> <PREFIX> [--level N]` creates one, `card plan accept <PREFIX>` records in the outline which content of the specification it was written from, `card plan start <id>` creates the card file for a row, and `card plan check <id>` checks one card against the working tree.
- Outlines, in `<cards_dir>/plan/`. A row is a card without a body.

### Changed

- `card list`, `card next`, `card status` and `card show` include rows. In a repository with no outline they print what they printed before.
- `/workdeck:next-card` writes the card when it starts a row. It fills the body in against the code as it is, checks it, asks for a yes before any code, and commits the approved card alone.
- `/workdeck:handoff` adds to the pull request body what changed in a planned card since it was approved.
- `/workdeck:init` no longer stops in a repository that has `workdeck.conf`. It offers the permission entries the settings file lacks, lockfiles and generated files for `touch_ignore`, review rules taken from the repository, and the current protocol section. It asks before each. A first run in a new repository also offers the `touch_ignore` entries and the review rules.
- The reviewer agent lists the requirements under a planned card's specification headings that the card neither covers nor excludes.
- The end-of-turn hook does not count commits that change nothing outside the cards directory, so the commit of an approved card does not ask for a session log. It finds the session log when it runs in a subdirectory, where it asked for one that was there.
- The permission template allows the push of a `plan/*` branch, and denies that push with a further argument. It also denies a push whose last argument is `--delete` or `-d`; a push with either flag elsewhere in the command was denied before. The protocol section for `CLAUDE.md` has two new lines.
- `/workdeck:init` writes a cards or log directory that has another name into the protocol section, on a first run and on a later one. Where a settings file or the permission template does not parse as JSON, init names the file and writes nothing to a settings file.
- `card new` refuses a card path that is a symbolic link, with exit 1. Before, it wrote through a link whose target did not exist.

### Upgrading from 0.1

- The configuration, card and session log formats do not change, and `workdeck.conf` stays at `version = 1`. A repository that does not use the planner works as before, with the exceptions listed under Changed, which need no outline: those to init, to the end-of-turn hook, to the permission template and to `card new`.
- To plan in a repository set up with 0.1, run `/workdeck:init` again and commit what it wrote before you type `/workdeck:plan`. A plugin installed before the planner was complete on the main branch lacks the skill, the changed init, or both. It receives them when the version changes, and you update the plugin then.
- From 0.1.2 or earlier, do the steps of 0.1.3 first.
- A CI workflow that names the tag `v0.1.3` keeps passing on a planned deck, because that `card` does not read outlines. One thing fails it, at that tag and on the main branch: a card that depends on a row with no card file, whether the card was written by hand or by `card plan start`. The `card` at that tag has no `plan` command.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-09

The code of 0.1.2 under the name WorkDeck. The project was renamed after `v0.1.2` was tagged and the version was not changed, so that tag holds the former name, Mergehand.

### Changed

- The configuration file is `workdeck.conf` and the skills are `/workdeck:*`. The plugin and its marketplace are both named `workdeck`. Nothing else differs from 0.1.2.

### Upgrading from 0.1.2

- A plugin installed under the former name stays as it is: its skills are `/mergehand:*` and its `card` reads `mergehand.conf`. Remove it and install `workdeck@workdeck`, as the README's install section says.
- The `card` at the tag `v0.1.2` reads `mergehand.conf`, and exits 2 in a repository with `workdeck.conf`. Download `card` from `v0.1.3`.
- A CI workflow that names the tag `v0.1.2` has to name `v0.1.3`.
- `card` does not read `mergehand.conf`. A repository that still has that file renames it to `workdeck.conf`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- The quick skill did not say that a card item starts with `- `. In the first run from the marketplace it wrote bare lines under `Touch`, and the scope gate did not match them. The skill now says so and runs `card lint` before it shows the card.
- `card lint` reported such a section as having no items, with no hint. The message now says what an item is.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- The README shows a session, compares the plugin with other projects, and has sections on upgrading and on what to do when a skill stops. The command list, the card states and the configuration keys moved to `docs/reference.md`.
- Releases carry `card` and `card.sha256`.

### Fixed

- The handoff skill told the user to push when the repository has no remote. It now says to merge the branch, or to add a remote.
- The init skill and the design said teammates get the plugin from the project settings. Each teammate installs it once.
- `SECURITY.md` said `card --fetch` was the only network access in the plugin. The skills pull, push and call `gh`.
- The README said the license card was the last card of 0.1 and that the project was built in the open. Neither was true.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-06

First release: the core, the runner and the quick lane.

### Added

- `card`, a single-file bash command: `next`, `show`, `list`, `status`, `new`, `done`, `lint`, `touched`, `tests`, `tokens`, `log-new`, `stats`, `conf`.
- Card files with flat front matter, and one session log per session.
- Card state derived from branches, pull requests and the base branch; nothing is stored but `done`.
- Two mechanical gates: `card touched` (scope) and `card tests` (named tests exist).
- Context growth measured from the session transcript and recorded in each session log.
- Four hooks: session status, a budget warning, a log guard and a compaction marker.
- Skills `/workdeck:init`, `/workdeck:next-card`, `/workdeck:handoff` and `/workdeck:quick`, and a reviewer agent.

### Not in this release

- Writing cards from a specification (planned for 0.2).
- Claiming cards, worktrees and parallel sessions (planned for 0.3).
- Hosts other than GitHub for the pull request step, and native Windows shells.
